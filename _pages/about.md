I am a senior Computer Science & Engineering student at Sharif University of Technology, currently shifting my focus from Computer Science to Economics. Broadly speaking, my interests lie at the intersection of Economics, Political Science, and Mathematics. My goal is to design systems that better capture our intuitions about inclusivity, peace, liberty, and growth compared to the status quo. I aim to approach this challenge from a scientific and rigorous perspective.
