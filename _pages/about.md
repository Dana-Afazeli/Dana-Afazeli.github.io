I'm a senior Computer Science & Engineering student at Sharif University of 
Technology. Currently, I'm shifting my focus from Computer Science to Economics. 
Broadly speaking, my interests revolve around the intersection of Economics, 
Political Science, and Mathematics; I aim to design systems that capture our 
intuitions about inclusivity, peace, liberty and growth better than the status quo.
I hope to approach this problem from a scientific / rigorous perspective.
