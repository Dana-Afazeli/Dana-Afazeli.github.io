In this piece I extend the decentralized resource allocation problem by adding
constraints to each agent's actions. These constraints are unknown as well as the
utility functions and agents have to learn them as they go. I combine the results
of two papers by Kamgarpour et al. and Maddux et al. in order to provide a unified 
framework to address this problem and provide theoretical guarantees for the
performance of the proposed algorithm.
