After the completion of
<a href="http://localhost:4000/writing-sample/EPFL-phase-1" rel="permalink">
first phase </a>,
we moved our focus to games with coupled constraints. Our initial goal was to
repeat the work done phase 1 with this additional complexity. It soon turned out
that this was not possible as there was not much analogous results for coupled 
constraints setting. This led me to take a step back and focus on developing the
necessary theory. My main goal was to find a dynamics that resulted in a 
solution concept,
analogous to no-regret dynamics and CCE. In the end, I was not able to find
a satisfying answer, but I proposed a definition for this analogous solution concept
named C3E (Constrained Coarse Correlated Equilibrium) which I believed was a natural
extension of the original concept. You can find the documentation of my results
and arguments in this work.
